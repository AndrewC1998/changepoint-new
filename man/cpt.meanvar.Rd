Identifying Changes in Mean and Variance
}
\description{
Calculates the optimal positioning and (potentially) number of changepoints for data using the user specified method.
}
\usage{
cpt.meanvar(data,penalty="MBIC",pen.value=0,method="AMOC",Q=5,test.stat="Normal",
class=TRUE,param.estimates=TRUE,shape=1,minseglen=2)
}
\arguments{
  \item{data}{
	A vector, ts object or matrix containing the data within which you wish to find a changepoint.  If data is a matrix, each row is considered a separate dataset.
}
  \item{penalty}{
  Choice of "None", "SIC", "BIC", "MBIC", AIC", "Hannan-Quinn", "Asymptotic", "Manual" and "CROPS" penalties.  If Manual is specified, the manual penalty is contained in the pen.value parameter. If Asymptotic is specified, the theoretical type I error is contained in the pen.value parameter.  If CROPS is specified, the penalty range is contained in the pen.value parameter; note this is a vector of length 2 which contains the minimum and maximum penalty value.  Note CROPS can only be used if the method is "PELT". The predefined penalties listed DO count the changepoint as a parameter, postfix a 0 e.g."SIC0" to NOT count the changepoint as a parameter.
}
  \item{pen.value}{
  The theoretical type I error e.g.0.05 when using the Asymptotic penalty.  A vector of length 2 (min,max) if using the CROPS penalty.  The value of the penalty when using the Manual penalty option - this can be a numeric value or text giving the formula to use.  Available variables are, n=length of original data, null=null likelihood, alt=alternative likelihood, tau=proposed changepoint, diffparam=difference in number of alternatve and null parameters.  
}
  \item{method}{
	Choice of "AMOC", "PELT" or "BinSeg".
}
  \item{Q}{
	The maximum number of changepoints to search for using the "BinSeg" method.
}
  \item{test.stat}{
	The assumed test statistic / distribution of the data.  Currently only "Normal", "Gamma", "Exponential" and "Poisson" are supported.
}
  \item{class}{
	Logical.  If TRUE then an object of class \code{cpt} is returned.
}
  \item{param.estimates}{
	Logical.  If TRUE and class=TRUE then parameter estimates are returned. If FALSE or class=FALSE no parameter estimates are returned.
}
  \item{shape}{
	Value of the assumed known shape parameter required when test.stat="Gamma".
}
  \item{minseglen}{
  Positive integer giving the minimum segment length (no. of observations between changes), default is the minimum allowed by theory.
  }
}
\details{
	This function is used to find changes in mean and variance for data using the test statistic specified in the test.stat parameter.  The changes are found using the method supplied which can be single changepoint (AMOC) or multiple changepoints using exact (PELT) or approximate (BinSeg) methods.  A changepoint is denoted as the last observation of the segment / regime.
}
\value{
  If \code{class=TRUE} then an object of S4 class "cpt" is returned.  The slot \code{cpts} contains the changepoints that are returned.  For \code{class=FALSE} the structure is as follows.

	If data is a vector (single dataset) then a vector/list is returned depending on the value of method.  If data is a matrix (multiple datasets) then a list is returned where each element in the list is either a vector or list depending on the value of method.

	If method is AMOC then a vector (one dataset) or matrix (multiple datasets) is returned, the columns are:
	\item{cpt}{The most probable location of a changepoint if a change was identified or NA if no changepoint.}
  \item{p value}{The p-value of the identified changepoint.}
	If method is PELT then a vector is returned containing the changepoint locations for the penalty supplied.  This always ends with n.
  If the penalty is CROPS then a list is returned with elements:
  \item{cpt.out}{A data frame containing the value of the penalty value where the number of segmentations changes, the number of segmentations and the value of the cost at that penalty value.}
  \item{changepoints}{The optimal changepoints for the different penalty values starting with the lowest penalty value}
	If method is BinSeg then a list is returned with elements:
	\item{cps}{2xQ Matrix containing the changepoint positions on the first row and the test statistic on the second row.}
	\item{op.cpts}{The optimal changepoint locations for the penalty supplied.}
	\item{pen}{Penalty used to find the optimal number of changepoints.}
